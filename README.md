Arepo public version
====================

AREPO is a massively parallel code for gravitational n-body
systems and hydrodynamics, both on Newtonian as well as
cosmological background. It is a flexible code that can be
applied to a variety of different types of simulations, offering
a number of sophisticated simulation algorithms.

This mirror of AREPO is intended for use with ArepoVTK.

Note that without the `AREPOVTK` compile time option, this code is identical to the public version.

The master repository of the AREPO public codebase is:
